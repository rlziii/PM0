PM/0 System

To Compile
----------
The correct way to compile this is as follows:
    gcc -o PM0 PM0_LA.c PM0_PCG.c PM0_VM.c PM0_Compiler.c

To Execute
----------
There are five flags/arguments for this program
Two of these are REQUIRED, three are OPTIONAL
The required format is as follows:
    ./PM0 -i [input file] -o [output file]

There are also three optional flags/arguments
    -a      Output the list of lexemes/tokens to the screen
    -l      Output the generated assembly code to the screen
    -v      Output the virtual machine execution trace to the screen
These flags/arguments can also be used in any combination

The following will print out everything:
    ./PM0 -alv -i [input file] -o [output file]

The program produces the following files:
    la_output.txt       Output from Lexical Analyzer (PM0_LA)

    pcg_output.txt      Output from Parser-Code Generator (PM0_PCG)

    [output file]       Output from Virtual Machine (PM0_VM)

A test file is included:
    test.txt
It can be ran through the program as follows:
    ./PM0 -i test.txt -o test.out
Or with all flags/arguments set to print to the screen:
    ./PM0 -alv -i test.txt -o test.out
